			<h1>Hello, I'm Romain 😃</h1>

			<p>
				I love climbing, reading and listening music. I have recently become interested in web3, especially in cryptos ₿.

			<h2>Climbing 🧗🏼</h2>
			<p>
				I am passionate about <strong>Climbing</strong>. I started this sport one and a half year ago. It takes an important place in my life and it changed me for the better. Climbing helped me get through a tough period in my adolescence. I am grateful to my cousins for introducing me to this incredible sport. Incredible is the right word, as this sport, or rather, art, provides so much in terms of physical benefits and personal qualities.

	    	<h2>Reading 📚</h2>
			<p>
				I am passionate about <strong>Reading</strong>. "I have been reading since I was young, and it's a passion that has helped me grow. Reading has always fascinated me, as it has allowed me to discover new worlds and imagine stories in my head. I believe that the creativity and imagination I possess today are partly due to this passion.

	    	<h2>Music 💿</h2>
			<p>
				I am passionate about <strong> Music</strong>. Music, like for many people, is an important element in my life. Unlike reading, I started listening to music rather late, yet today I am truly passionate about it. I enjoy listening to all sorts of genres to experience different emotions and not stay in my own bubble. I received a record player for my recent birthday, which allowed me to rediscover certain genres and artists, but more broadly, vinyl records have allowed me to rediscover music in general.
